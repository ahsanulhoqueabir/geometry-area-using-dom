          What Is DOM And What Is The Purpose Of DOM?
        </h1>
        <article class="text-sm text-justify space-y-3">
          <p>
            The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web
            documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the
            document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the
            document as nodes and objects. That way, programming languages can
            connect to the page.
          </p>
          <p>
            A web page is a document that can be either displayed in the browser
            window or as the HTML source. In both cases, it is the same document
            but the Document Object Model (DOM) representation allows it to be
            manipulated. As an object-oriented representation of the web page,
            it can be modified with a scripting language such as JavaScript.
          </p>
          <p>
            The DOM represents a document with a logical tree. Each branch of
            the tree ends in a node, and each node contains objects. DOM methods
            allow programmatic access to the tree; with them you can change the
            document's structure, style, or content. Nodes can also have event
            handlers attached to them; once an event is triggered, the event
            handlers get executed.

          How Will You Select HTML Elements Using DOM? Name The DOM Methods.

          <p>
            The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML
            and XML documents. It represents the structure of the document as a
            tree of objects, allowing you to manipulate its content and visual
            presentation. Each object represents a part of the document, such as
            an element or attribute.

            <h1 class="text-xl font-bold">What Is Event Bubble?</h1>
            <article class="text-sm text-justify space-y-3">
                <p>Event Bubbling is a concept in the DOM (Document Object Model). It happens when an element receives an event, and that event bubbles up (or you can say is transmitted or propagated) to its parent and ancestor elements in the DOM tree until it gets to the root element.</p>
                <p>For example, if you have a <code>div</code> element and a <code>button</code> element inside the <code>div</code>, and you have a click event listener on both the <code>div</code> and the <code>button</code>, when you click the button, the event will bubble up from the button to the <code>div</code>.</p>
                <p>Event bubbling is a mechanism that allows events to propagate upward from
                    the element that was clicked on to its ancestors in the DOM tree.</p>

            <h1 class="text-xl font-bold">What Is A Callback Function And Why Will You Use It?</h1>
            <article class="text-sm text-justify space-y-3">
                <p>A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function, to be “called back” at a later time. A function that accepts other functions as arguments is called a higher-order function, which contains the logic for when the callback function gets executed. It is used to make sure that a function is not executed before a task is completed but after the task is completed, otherwise
                    the function will not work properly.</p>
                    <p>
                        We need callback functions because many JavaScript actions are asynchronous, which means they don't really stop the program (or a function) from running until they're completed, as you're probably used to. Instead, it will execute in the background while the rest of the code runs.
